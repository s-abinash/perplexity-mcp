- ÔøΩ Returns ranked search results with titles, URLs, and snippets
- üìÖ Publication dates and last updated timestamps
- üåç Regional search with country filtering
- üéØ Domain filtering to limit results to specific websites
- üîÑ Multi-query support (up to 5 queries in one request)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable result count and content extraction depth

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Perplexity API key (get one from [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-abinash/perplexity-mcp.git
cd perplexity-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Setting up your API Key

You need to set the `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` environment variable with your Perplexity API key.

**Option 1: Export in your shell**

```

**Option 2: Use a .env file (for development)**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### MCP Client Configuration

To use this server with an MCP client like Claude Desktop, add the following to your MCP configuration file:

**For Claude Desktop on macOS** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/perplexity-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop on Windows** (`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\perplexity-mcp\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

The server provides one tool: `perplexity_search`

### Parameters

- `query` (required): String or array of strings (up to 5) - The search query/queries
- `max_results` (optional, default: 10): Number of results to return (1-20)
- `max_tokens_per_page` (optional, default: 1024): Maximum tokens to extract from each page
- `country` (optional): ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for regional search (e.g., "US", "GB", "DE", "JP")
- `search_domain_filter` (optional): Array of domains to filter results (max 20)

### Examples

**Basic Search:**
```json
{
  "query": "latest AI developments 2024",
  "max_results": 5
}
```

**Regional Search:**
```json
{
  "query": "government policies on renewable energy",
  "country": "US",
  "max_results": 10
}
```

**Domain-Filtered Search:**
```json
{
  "query": "climate change research",
  "search_domain_filter": ["science.org", "nature.com", "cell.com"],
  "max_results": 10
}
```

**Multi-Query Search:**
```json
{
  "query": [
    "artificial intelligence trends 2024",
    "machine learning breakthroughs",
    "AI applications in healthcare"
  ],
  "max_results": 5
}
```

### Response Format

The server returns formatted search results with:
- Result number and title
- URL
- Snippet (preview of the page content)
- Publication date (when available)
- Last updated date (when available)

**Single Query Response Example:**
```

## Example Usage with MCP Client

When using with an MCP client like Claude:

```
User: Can you search for "latest developments in quantum computing" and limit to academic sources?

Claude: I'll search for that using Perplexity's Search API.
[Uses perplexity_search tool with:
  query="latest developments in quantum computing"
  search_domain_filter=["arxiv.org", "science.org", "nature.com"]
  max_results=10
]
```

The server will return ranked search results from Perplexity's continuously refreshed index with titles, URLs, snippets, and publication dates.

## Development

Run the server in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```
